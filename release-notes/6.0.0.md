# Release Note 6.0.0 ML Analytics Service

This version contains set of manual activites tasks that must be completed in order to improve to upgrade the ML Analytics Service code to 6.0.0. Please consider the following list of tasks to be completed.

## Devops Changes:

### New Environment Keys Added

We added new environment keys to the DevOps repository ([PR link](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/pull/3849)) to as required for new features and functionality. For configuration and access to outside services or resources, these keys will be utilised.

Please note you don't need to deploy the DevOps repo. Once the PR is merged, deploy this service, env variable will automatically add from the DevOps branch.

In this release, we have introduced new environment variables as follows. 

    The Below value of these keys can be overridden or have values defined as needed using the private devops Repo path E.g. : ansible/inventory/staging/managed-learn/common.yml

            ml_analytics_authorization_access_token : "{{ ml_analytics_authorization_access_token }}"
            ml_analytics_client_id : "{{ ml_analytics_client_id }}"
            ml_analytics_client_secret : "{{ ml_analytics_client_secret }}"
            ml_analytics_username : "{{ ml_analytics_username }}"
            ml_analytics_password : "{{ ml_analytics_password }}"
            ml_analytics_createdBy : "{{ ml_analytics_createdBy }}"
            ml_analytics_api_base_url : "https://{{ domain_name }}/"
            ml_analytics_reports_store : "{{ cloud_service_provider }}"
            ml_analytics_reports_container : "{{ cloud_storage_privatereports_bucketname }}"
            ml_analytics_driver_memory: "{{ ml_analytics_driver_memory | default('50g') }}"
            ml_analytics_executor_memory: "{{ ml_analytics_executor_memory | default('50g') }}"


    We can use the existing user credentials or we can create new user by using below curl

            curl --location 'https://staging.sunbirded.org/api/user/v1/create' \
            --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{Bearer_token}}' \
            --header 'x-authenticated-user-token: {{access_token}}' \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data-raw '{
                "request": {
                    "firstName": "report",
                    "password": "{{password}}",
                    "email": "reportCreator@yopmail.com",
                    "userName": "ReportCreator",
                    "lastName": "creator",
                    "emailVerified":true,
                    "channel": "sunbird",
                    "roles":["PROGRAM_MANAGER", "PROGRAM_DESIGNER", "REPORT_ADMIN", "REPORT_VIEWER"]
                }
            }'

            Note: 
            1. The request body can be modified and used accordingly  

            2. The "ml_analytics_authorization_access_token" access token should have access to below api endpoints
                    
                    refresh_token = "auth/realms/sunbird/protocol/openid-connect/token"
                    access_token = "auth/v1/refresh/token"
                    backend_create = "api/data/v1/report/jobs/submit"
                    frontend_create = "/api/data/v1/report-service/report/create"
                    frontend_get = "/api/data/v1/report-service/report/get/"
                    backend_update = "/api/data/v1/report/jobs/"
                    frontend_update = "/api/data/v1/report-service/report/update/"
                    frontend_retire = "/api/data/v1/report-service/report/delete/"
                    backend_retire = "/report/jobs/deactivate/"
                    reports_list = "/api/data/v1/report-service/report/list"

            3. The value for ml_analytics_createdBy should be unique UUID of the user generated or being used and supplied to ml_analytics_username e.g. fb85a044-d9eb-479b-a55a-fer1bfaea14d

            4. The value for ml_analytics_client_secret is used for generating the keyclock access token. 
            e.g. fd241dce-46b9-47e1-97cf-1c7de7a44216

    2. Access the Jenkins UI by navigating to the appropriate URL.
    3. Once logged in, locate the "Deploy" section and select the desired environment (e.g., Staging, Production, etc.).
    4. In the selected environment, find the "DataPipeline" folder and click on it.
    5. Inside the "DataPipeline" folder, locate the "RunReportjob" job and click on it.
    6. On the job page, look for the option to "Build with Parameters" and click on it.
    7. You will be prompted to provide the required parameters for the job.
            1. Specify the "report_id" parameter with the appropriate value. ( you will find the values in this path - https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/ml-analytics-service/tree/release-6.0.0/migrations/releases/6.0.0/config/backend/create 
            Eg : ml_report_name )
            2. The "private_branch" parameter should default to the latest branch, so no action is needed unless specified otherwise.

    8. Once you have entered the necessary parameters, click on the "Build" button to start the job.
    9. The Jenkins job will now run, executing the required tasks to generate the CSV and JSON files in the cloud.
    10. Monitor the job's progress through the Jenkins UI to ensure it completes successfully.
    11. Once the job finishes, the CSV and JSON files should be generated in the designated cloud storage location.
